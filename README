This is a kernel driver for the Corsair Commander Pro.

Features:
Recognize connected fans, read fan speeds.
Read connected thermal sensors.
Set and read fan speed with single pwm value.
Set fan speed with target value.
Read voltage values.

If you would like to test it, clone the repository.
make && sudo insmod corsair-cpro.ko

If you run sensors, it should show up.

fan*_label shows the number and the connection status.
fan*_input shows the fan speed.
fan*_target sets target RPM values.
pwm* is takes numbers from 0-255.
temp*_input shows the temperature.
